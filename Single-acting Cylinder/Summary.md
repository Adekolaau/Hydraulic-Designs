# Summary of Single-Acting Hydraulic System Design

In this project, I designed a single-acting hydraulic cylinder system using FluidSim. The system features:

- 1 Single-Acting Cylinder
- 3 Tanks: Tank 1 is connected to a filter and a fixed displacement pump, Tank 2 receives excess pressure via a relief valve, and Tank 3 receives fluid from the DCV.
- 1 Filter
- 1 Manometer: Installed on the line between the pump and DCV to measure pressure.
- 1 Flow Meter: Installed on the line to the cylinder to measure flow rate.
- 1 Pressure Relief Valve: Ensures system safety by directing excess pressure to Tank 2.
- 1 Fixed Displacement Pump
- 1 Pressure Indicator
- 1 3/2-Way Hand-Lever Valve: Directs flow to either the cylinder or Tank 3.

This design effectively controls the single-acting cylinder, demonstrating my expertise in creating reliable and efficient hydraulic systems.

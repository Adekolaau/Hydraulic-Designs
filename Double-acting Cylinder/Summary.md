# Double-Acting Hydraulic Cylinder System Design Summary

Using FluidSim, I designed a comprehensive double-acting hydraulic cylinder system, showcasing my ability to create intricate hydraulic circuits. The system includes the following components and flow:

1. *Tank:* The hydraulic fluid is stored in the tank.
2. *Filter:* The fluid is filtered to remove impurities before entering the pumps.
3. *Fixed Displacement Pumps (2):* Two pumps are used to pressurize the hydraulic fluid.
4. *Shuttle Valve:* Directs the flow from either pump to the rest of the system.
5. *Shut-Off Valve:* Allows the isolation of the hydraulic circuit for maintenance or safety purposes.
6. *Manometer:* Measures the pressure in the line between the shuttle valve and the shut-off valve.
7. *Pressure Relief Valve:* Protects the system from overpressure by diverting excess fluid back to the tank.
8. *4/2-Way Hand-Lever Directional Control Valve (DCV):* Controls the direction of the fluid flow to the double-acting cylinder. It features a tandem-type configuration with a hand lever and a spring return mechanism.
9. *Check Valve:* Ensures fluid flows in one direction, preventing backflow.
10. *Double-Acting Cylinder:* The actuator that performs work in both directions.

**Flow Description:**

- The fluid from the tank is filtered and pressurized by the two fixed displacement pumps.
- The pressurized fluid is directed through the shuttle valve, then through the shut-off valve.
- The pressure in this line is monitored by the manometer, with excess pressure being relieved by the pressure relief valve back to the tank.
- The shut-off valve controls the flow to the 4/2-way hand-lever DCV, which then directs the fluid to either side of the double-acting cylinder.
- The check valve ensures proper fluid flow back to the tank from the DCV.
- This design highlights my expertise in creating efficient and functional hydraulic systems, ensuring reliability and performance.

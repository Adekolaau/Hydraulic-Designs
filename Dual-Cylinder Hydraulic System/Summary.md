# Dual-Cylinder Hydraulic System

Summary:
In this project, I designed a sophisticated dual-cylinder hydraulic system using FluidSim. The system incorporates two double-acting cylinders controlled by separate directional control valves (DCVs) to ensure precise and responsive operation. The design features a variable displacement pump that efficiently powers the system, with strategically placed manometers and pressure relief valves to monitor and manage pressure levels. The integration of check valves, flow control valves, and pilot-controlled valves ensures smooth, controlled movements of the cylinders. This advanced setup highlights my expertise in hydraulic system design, emphasizing reliability and efficiency in complex applications.
